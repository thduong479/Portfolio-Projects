# Movie Data Analysis 

Movies serve as a popular medium of entertainment, enjoyed by people worldwide. Yet, what factors contribute to a movie's success? Is it the budget, the rating, the genre, or the release date? To answer this question, I will conduct an analysis of a movie dataset, with the goal of identifying the elements that impact a film's performance. I will examine the average budget of movies over time, the most frequent movie ratings, the genres with the highest and lowest average ratings, and the correlation between a movie's release date and its gross earnings.

This project aims to analyze Movie Data from **1980 - 2020**.  

In this project, I have used a dataset from Kaggle:

## Questions to be explored
1. What are the top 10 highest-grossing movies of 2019-2020?
2. What is the relationship between budget and gross?
3. What is the most common rating for movies in the dataset?
4. Which genres of movies tend to have the highest gross earnings?
5. How has the average budget of movies changed over time?
6. Do movies released in the summer months tend to have higher gross earnings than movies released in other months of the year?
7. What is the average score for each genre?

## Analysis Steps
1. **Step 1:** Install + Import Necessary Libraries
2. **Step 2:** Reading + Exploring Data
3. **Step 3**: Data Cleaning (handling the null and missing values)
4. **Step 4:** Data Analysis + Visualization
5. **1980 - 2020 Movie Data Analysis Final Results**

## Summary
The analysis conducted thus far yields several key findings:

1. Movie budgets have seen a significant rise over time, likely due to factors such as increased production costs, the pursuit of visually stunning and intricate films, a global audience appeal, and heightened competition from other entertainment forms.
2. The most prevalent movie rating in the dataset is PG, implying that a majority of films are suitable for general audiences with parental guidance.
3. Biographical, dramatic, and animated genres have the highest average ratings in the dataset, while Western, thriller, and horror genres have the lowest.
4. Movies that are released in the summer are more likely to have high gross earnings than movies that are released in the winter. This could be due to a number of factors, including the fact that people are more likely to go to the movies during the summer, summer movies are often marketed towards families and children, and summer movies are often blockbusters.

In conclusion, this analysis indicates that several factors, including budget, rating, genre, and release date, can influence a movie's success. However, it is important to remember that there are exceptions, and great films can be found across all genres and budgets.

## Discussion
The outcomes of our analysis give rise to a series of intriguing inquiries. For instance, what drives the continuous rise in the average budget of films? Is this trend beneficial or detrimental? How does the escalating budget of movies impact their overall quality? Furthermore, what accounts for the varying popularity of certain movie genres? Is it primarily tied to the quality of the films, or are other factors such as marketing and distribution at play?

These are just a few of the questions that could be explored further. Additional research could be done to investigate these questions in more depth and to identify other factors that may influence the success of a movie.
